# notes

Not all the requirements were met:
- If the search returns no result, no behavior is implemented.
- The image column does not have a header
- In case of special artist names the alignment in the csv file is off.

It took me longer than the estimated time to complete this project.
Nonetheless I've learned a lot and most importantly had a lot of fun creating it.
