# notes

Not all the requirements were met:
- if the search returns no result, no behavior is implemented.
- the image column does not have a header
- in case of special artist names the alignment in the csv file is off.
- The path to which the csv file should be saved can not be specified.

It took me longer than the estimated time to complete this project (around 8 hours).
Nonetheless I've learned a lot and most importantly had a lot of fun creating it.
